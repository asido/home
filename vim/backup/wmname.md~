WMNAME
======
wmname prints/sets the window manager name property of the root window similar
to how hostname(1) behaves. This property is used by many programs to identify the
machine.

wmname is a nice utility to fix problems with JDK versions and other broken
programs assuming a reparenting window manager for instance.
